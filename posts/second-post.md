# Second Post

Here's another sample post to demonstrate how multiple posts appear in the list. Write your content in Markdown — headings, lists, code blocks, images, links, everything will be converted.

Example code:

```js
console.log('Hello from the blog!');
```

That's it — add more posts by creating Markdown files with YAML frontmatter in posts/.
