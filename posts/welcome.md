# Welcome to the Minimalist Blog

This is a tiny blog built for GitHub Pages. It reads posts from Markdown files inside the `posts/` folder and loads them on the client.

- Minimal HTML/CSS/JS
- Posts are plain Markdown with YAML frontmatter
- No index.json required

Enjoy!

```bash
# To add a post
# 1. add posts/new-post.md with YAML frontmatter (title, date, slug, excerpt)
```
